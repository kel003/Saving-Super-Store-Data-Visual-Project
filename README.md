# Saving-Super-Store-Data-Visual-Project
A super store is in need of data cleaning to understand its operations and also wants to increase its profitability . 
After data has been sorted I will use the new findings to propose a new buiness model to avoid bankruptcy.

 First i will focus on the profits and losses the company generates by sub category and region in a bar chart visual.
 The visual i created addressed that copiers and phones were the biggest profit makers. Copiers generated the most profits on the west 
 coast. Phones on the other hand generted the most profits on the east coast of the U.S. 

 My 2nd visual was created to show the biggest loss makers. Bookcases and tables located in the south and central regions were the 
 cause of our biggest financial deficits. 

 Now that we have a understanding of which items are the most and least profitable, I will now shift the focus on the 3 products the 
 company should focus on marketing the most and which 3 they should stop selling.

 I will now compare profits of all sub categories in a bar chart visual and filter the data to top 3. Copiers ,accessories and phones 
 are the most profitable sub categories and should recieve the most focus in marketing. Bookcases,supplies and tables were our bottom 
 3 subcategories and are in need of new marketing models to help produces more revenue for these item.
